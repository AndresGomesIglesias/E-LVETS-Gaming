                            <p>E-LVETS is a non profit association founded in February of 2016 by Andres Gomes Iglesias,
                                GaÃ«l Panchaud and Boris Mayencourt.

                                Having played many games for many years they decided together to found an e-sports club
                                that would become, in less than two years, one of the best success stories of
                                Switzerland.

                                Today, E-LVETS counts over 85 members comprising of League of Legends, CS:GO, Smash Bros
                                4, Overwatch, Fifa, Rocket League and Hearthstone teams.

                                Our goals are not only to create and coach high level teams but also to scout and coach
                                young players with high potential.

                                Our goals as defined by our statutes are :





                                <ul class="list">

                                    <li>Develop the image of e-sports in Switzerland and around the world</li>
                                    <li>Discover new talents and offer them a structure suitable to their blossoming
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Take part and organise events in Switzerland</li>
                                    <li> Create social interactions between members</li>
                                </ul>

                                We are also involved in multiple inter-associations projects notably in Geneva where we
                                are part of the Geneva Esport. We can also mention ChablaisLan a lan party project we
                                organise every year in Wallis.We are active members of the Swiss Federation of
                                Electronic Sports as well with our president, Boris Mayencourt, being their
                                vice-president.

                                Finally, we are initiators of inter-associations projects with ChablaisLAN, initiated by
                                Rotary Clubs of Aigle, Monthey and Chablais, which was picked up by E-LVETS and then
                                transformed in an association, which counts Absolute Frost among its members, through
                                which we organise the ChablaisLAN every year at the ECCG of Monthey.</p>
